MSConfirmAlertView
==================

Simple wrapper around UIAlertView that was made pre-blocks to make it a bit simpler for one-off confirmation dialogs. Instead of conforming to yet another protocol, just tell MSConfirmAlertView what you'd like to do if the user confirms.

TaggedNSURLConnection
====================

Extremely simple wrapper around NSURLConnection to allow some identification, in case you'll be running multiple types of requests in the same delegate.
